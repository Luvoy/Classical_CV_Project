pysift:

Based on [pysift](https://github.com/rmislam/PythonSIFT) implemented by [@rmislam](https://github.com/rmislam/) using pure python from scratch, its data structure and algorithm are similar to the method described in Opencv, for which it's a good way to learn the theory of sift though inefficient.

For any other details, please read the code.
